1392767042537746433	2021-05-13 09:01:53	No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.
1392766987676262409	2021-05-13 09:01:40	Regrettably, the film fails.
1392766952943222785	2021-05-13 09:01:32	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.
1392766911876796417	2021-05-13 09:01:22	The character developments also lacked in depth.

1392766546343120896	2021-05-13 08:59:55	This film has no redeeming features.
1392766500331671553	2021-05-13 08:59:44	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.

1392749618476183552	2021-05-13 07:52:39	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.
1392749568291328000	2021-05-13 07:52:27	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.
1392749195430273027	2021-05-13 07:50:58	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.
1392749136932261890	2021-05-13 07:50:44	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Prakash Raj.

1392748452769976323	2021-05-13 07:48:01	This was a flick doomed from its conception.
